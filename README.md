Appacitive Java/Android SDK
===========================

This is the official Android and Java SDK for [Appacitive](http://www.appacitive.com/).

### Usage

1. Run `mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true` in the root directory.
2. You can then pick up the android or java SDK jar from the `target` folder in their respective platform folders. The android SDK will be named something like `appacitive-android-1.0.jar` and the java SDK will be named something like `appacitive-java-1.0.jar`

These SDK jars have all their dependencies included in them. Simple add the SDK jar to your project and you are ready to go.
